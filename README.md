# CNAS.Repository

## Who
I am a software engineer and I like building custom solutions that fit my needs.

But as they are **not** professional solutions, i manually include my libraries over and over.

This is not only in conflict with the DRY principle, but also a waste of time.

## Why
To solve this *problem* i'm creating a set of libraries:
1. CNAS.Presentation
2. CNAS.Business
3. CNAS.Repository

## What
CNAS is an achronym for **C**lean .**N**ET **A**PI **S**ervice.

With the Repository library you can create a clean data access layer, following the repository pattern.

The idea is to create a nuget package for this library, to make it fast and easy to include in new projects.

The nuget package will be publicly deployed on the nuget store.

## How

### Install
1. Search for "CNAS.Repository" in the nuget store
2. Install said nuget

### Usage

*Instructions on how to import and work with this library will follow...*
